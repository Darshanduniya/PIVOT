Dear Team,

I would like to clarify that I have not copied any code to external websites. The portal I used for formatting purposes was allowed within the Harman network, and it helped me to solve indentation issues. Moreover, Harman did not block this portal.

Although I partially copied some code, it's essential to note that there was no sensitive data or company information included in the external portal. The code in question was testing code, which I personally developed.

I apologize for any confusion this may have caused and assure you that I take data security seriously. I will be more cautious in the future while handling code and ensuring it stays within our network.

Thank you for your understanding, and I appreciate your support in maintaining a secure coding environment
